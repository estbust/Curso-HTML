    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>
        <blockquote>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</blockquote> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> and scripting languages such as <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a programming language.

    <h2>Historia de HTML</h2>
    <p>
        In 1980, physicist <cite>Berners-Lee</cite>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, <cite>Berners-Lee</cite> wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.
